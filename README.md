Learn what payment processing is 
and how you can add it to your application!

# Why? 🤷

Sadly, not all applications can be "free";
the software engineers that build them need to be paid
and the underlying infrastructure costs money too.
Many Apps cover their costs through advertising.
But this is selling the "users" data,
which we are not fans of ...

> "_When something online is free, 
> you're not the customer, 
> you're the product._"

Some apps are sold via **one time purchase**.
Others are **subscription-based**.
Regardless of the type, 
all of these share one thing in common:
**they use payment processing gateways
to collect funds**.

# What 💭

There are several Payment processing providers,
the most recognisable are: 
[`PayPal`](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/),
[`Stripe`](https://stripe.com)
or 
[`Square`](https://squareup.com/us/en/).


## Payment Processor or Gateway 🤷‍♀️

![payment-processor-gateway](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208946952-4da1600e-9936-4491-9a6e-a5a7e09c023c.png)

A **payment processor** functions as an intermediary
between the customer's bank (or digital wallet)
and the merchant
(which consists of the merchant and their bank).
It is the entity responsible for communicating
between both parties in the transaction.

A **payment gateway**
is a virtual
[*point of sale*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)
for online payments.
Similar to when a customer swipes/taps their card
on a **_physical_ credit card terminal**,
online stores need a gateway to securely collect
the customer's card details. 
A payment gateway 
acts like is a _virtual_ credit card terminal.

The whole process of online payment
usually assumes the merchant
has a 
[**merchant account**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merchant-account.asp).
A merchant account is simply
a type of business bank account
that *allows a business
to receive credit card 
and other electronic funds transfers*.

> **Note**: the terms 
> `payment processor` 
> and `payment gateway` 
> usually fall under the same term;
`payment processor`. 
This is because they work together to handle payment processing. 
So if you see platforms like `Stripe` 
being mentioned as a "payment processor",
it's because it offers both `payment gateway` 
and `payment processor` 
bundled together 
alongside a myriad of other features such as fraud prevention.

## `PayPal` The Original Payment Processor
Okay... I've seen people using `Paddle`. Is it any different?

If you've done much online shopping,
you have probably came across a button like this,
which allows you to purchase the item through `Paypal`:

![paypal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208951049-421e123a-e082-433e-8b08-60c7da8c8a57.png)

If you want to add a way for `people` to purchase
an item in your application through `PayPal`,
you'd have to setup a `PayPal` account
and use one of their SDKs:
[developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/home)

You are basically using the 
`PayPal` E-commerce platform
[paypal.com/us/business/platforms](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/platforms-and-marketplaces)
to setup a payment gateway and processor
for users to pay with Paypal on your site.

Awesome! 🎉

Now want to add 
[`Google Pay`](https://pay.google.com/about/business/implementation/), 
as a payment method, as well.
You'd have to create an account,
use [their SDK](https://developers.google.com/pay/api)
and integrate it in your website.

We shouldn't forget iPhone users as well!
We also want (need!) to add an [`Apple Pay`](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/)
payment method to our application.
Same procedure occurs, we ought to create an account
and use [their SDK](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/)
to integrate it into our application.

On top of this, we need to create our own merchant account
so each one of these services can connect to it
and process the transactions.

This is a heap of effort 
and can easily scale to unsustainable levels.
This is where **payment platforms** 
like Stripe come into play.

## Payment platforms

Payment platforms **simplify the process of connecting
to multiple third-parties**. 
It offers more than a payment service 
so that merchants only have to liaise with one company 
rather than multiple ones. 

This has a great impact on how an application
is *designed* and *implemented*, 
and allows to for a better management
and [decoupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
of responsibilities.

Instead of our own API having to manage different providers, 
we can use a platform like `Stripe` to do the work for us.
This is how the application should be laid out!

![design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208956397-cda6d895-8034-45b0-bc91-61befb012fb3.png)

As you can see, it is much simpler!
By offering a bundle of essential payment technologies,
these companies are reducing the merchant's work
of having to manage each of them separately.
In addition to this, there are a number of other advantages,
such as security, data monitoring and reporting.

For example, `Stripe` is like having a multiple
**payment processors**, **payment gateways** and **merchant account**
bundled into one, 
along with a [myriad of other features](https://stripe.com/en-pt).

## Stripe and alternatives

`Stripe` is considered by many to be 
the [*de facto*](https://trends.builtwith.com/payment/Stripe)
way of accepting credit cards
and electronic payments on the web. 
It's a powerful payment tool 
that has a number of additional features, 
including [smart retries](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries),
[automatic card updater](https://stripe.com/docs/saving-cards),
[fraud tooling](https://stripe.com/en-gb-pt/radar), 
and [others](https://stripe.com/partners/directory). 

However, it is important to note that there are
several other options that do offer similar features,
ease of payment integration into your application 
but handle payments in a different way.

For example, `Paddle`, as we have mentioned earlier,
works on a completely different way.
While `Stripe` can be compared to a payment gateway
that deals with multiple channels, 
`Paddle` offers similar features
but acts a *reseller of your services* - 
**merchant of record (MoR)**.

A MoR is ["a term to describe the legal entity
selling goods or services to an end customer"](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record).
It's who the end customer owes payment for their purchase,
and it is who handles payments and liability for each transaction.
This is great for *tax handling*, 
[which is especially relevant in Europe](https://www.outseta.com/posts/startup-payment-processing)
and one of the reasons people 
[consider `Paddle` in lieu of `Stripe`](https://splitbee.io/blog/why-we-moved-from-stripe-to-paddle).
`Stripe` is making strides in also having
[better tax compliance](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/taxjar)
but it's not quite there, at the moment of writing.

![mor](https://images.prismic.io/paddle/d6ff57bb-31dd-41ed-86c6-23d73584b617_merchant+of+record.png?auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=react-9.5.4)

So businesses can choose to be their own merchant of record
and setup an infrastructure and processes needed to manage
payments with `Stripe` and deal with liabilities
and tax handling themselves.
*Or* they can use MoR service providers like `Paddle`
who take the burden of all of payment processing 
and legal compliance away. Of course, these usually incur higher fees than `Stripe`.

## I'm confused. Which one should I choose?

[That's a great question](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/stripe-vs-paddle-89161b0d5c).

[Which seems to asked](https://splitbee.io/blog/why-we-moved-from-stripe-to-paddle)
[over](https://stackshare.io/stackups/paddle-vs-stripe),
and [over](https://www.paddle.com/compare/stripe)
and [over](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/q3kao9/paddle_vs_chargebee_vs_stripe_any_recommendations/) again.

Depending on the use-case or your choice,
each product provides different pricing plans, fees and features
and you should make this decision 
based on the requirements of your project
and how much you are willing to spend.

What's important here is you know
*how online payments work*, 
what parties are involved 
and how you can **leverage these platforms**
to make this process easier. 

Remember, we are dealing with **sensitive information**.
Credit card info should be handled with *extreme caution*
amd these platforms makes it easier for us to do just that.

But implementation-wise,
when designing and implementing your application,
you should notice that 
the process is similar between whatever alternative you choose.
Your application will make use of their SDKs
to integrate different channels 
and payment alternatives to process transactions.

And guess what,
you are going to be doing that in the next section!

Race you there! 🏃

# How? 💻

In this section, 
we are going to be implementing an example application
using Stripe with Elixir.

> If you have never programmed in Elixir,
we recommend checking the 
[`learn-elixir`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir) 
and [`learn-phoenix-framework`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework)
repositories before you start this walk-through,
as we are going to be focusing on payment processing,
and not on the basics of a Phoenix project. 

The reason we went with `Stripe` 
and not any other alternative like `Paddle` 
is because `Stripe` allows us to create an account
without having to fill business-related information,
KYC and a company website.

## Pre-requisites

For this tutorial,
you will need to create a `Stripe` account.
If you visit https://dashboard.stripe.com/register,
you will be prompted to create an account.

<img width="1345" alt="stripe-create" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208978760-84f42dfd-7eee-4363-b250-6dcca0ee90b7.png">

After filling your information,
and verifying your account, 
you will be able to access the main dashboard.
If you type "API" inside the search box 
and choose `Developers > API Keys`...

<img width="1345" alt="dashboard" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208983008-93f34198-3d0e-4d7b-a493-ccbe87afa5b6.png">

You will be prompted with the following window.

<img width="1345" alt="keys" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208983428-c75a0df2-a088-40fe-a68c-3193c829a3a4.png">

These API keys will later be used in the tutorial.
Save them and don't show them to anyone else!
We are going to be using these
as [environment variables](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables).

Make sure you also have 
[`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/)
and [`Phoenix 1.7rc`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
installed.

## 1. Create a Phoenix project

Let's start by creating a Phoenix project.
Run `mix phx.new app` 
and when prompted, type `y` to accept downloading the dependencies.

After this, if you run `mix phx.server`
and visit `localhost:4000`, 
you will be able to see the default landing page.

![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209141154-a9d88988-6a36-4faa-8bbf-f1cf09684bf5.png)

We will want the user to be able to log in.
We will check if the user has *paid* or not
for using the application. 
If he hasn't, he is redirected to a `buy` page.
If he has, he will have access to it!

It's a simple application, for sure.
But it's still important to know **how** to properly implement it.

## 2. Add `auth_plug` for user login

We will be using 
[`auth_plug`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug)
so users are able to login.

Let's install it.
Add the following to the `deps` section in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:auth_plug, "~> 1.5.1"}
  ]
end
```

And run `mix deps.get`.
If you [follow the package instructions](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug)
and get your `AUTH_API_KEY`.

Now head over to `lib/app_web/router.ex`
and add the following lines of code.

```elixir
  pipeline :auth, do: plug(AuthPlug)

  scope "/dashboard", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    pipe_through :auth

    get "/", AppController, :home
  end
```

The `/dashboard` protected endpoint will only be accessible
for logged in users because we are using the 
`:auth` pipeline.

We are using `AppController`, 
which is not yet created. 
Create the following files.

- `lib/app_web/controllers/app_controller.ex`
- `lib/app_web/controllers/app_html.ex`
- `lib/app_web/controllers/app_html/app.html.heex`

Inside `app_html.ex`, add the following code.

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppHTML do
  use AppWeb, :html

  embed_templates "app_html/*"
end
```


Inside `app_controller.ex`, add the following code.

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  def home(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, :app, layout: false)
  end
end
```

And finally, inside `app_html/app.html.heex`:

```html
<div>
    logged in
</div>
```

Now, you can create a local file 
called `.env` 
(don't forget to **never commit this file**, 
as it contains sensitive information and API keys)
and paste the following.

```sh
export AUTH_API_KEY=XXXX
```

If you run `source .env` 
and restart your server with `mix phx.server`
and access `/dashboard` directly,
you will be redirected to a page where you can SSO using Google or Github.

<img width="1345" alt="redirection" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209158781-5242b18f-9abb-4c0c-8703-5be7ed9509f7.png">

After logging in, 
the user has access to the URL!

<img width="686" alt="successful_login" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209159171-ee959b68-f4f6-4e69-bf7f-5e0552c1108e.png">

Congratulations, you just added basic authenticated to our application!
However, that's not quite what we want. 
We want the user to be logged in 
and *also* being a paying costumer so they have access to `/dashboard`.

We can make it prettier, though.
Let's add two endpoints:
- one to login (`/login`)
- one to logout (`/logout`)

From the landing page, 
we are going to be adding a button that will log the user in,
and redirect to the `/login` URL.
After logging in, he will be redirected back to the home page.
We will need to conditionally render the home page (`/`)
according to the user being logged in or not.

For this, we are going to be using
an [`optional auth pipeline`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug#optional-auth).
It will add allow us show custom actions on people who are authenticated or not.
This pipeline will add the logged in to the `conn.assigns`.

Head on to `lib/app_web/router.ex` 
and add/change the following piece of code.

```elixir
  pipeline :authoptional, do: plug(AuthPlugOptional, %{})

  scope "/", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    pipe_through :authoptional

    get "/", PageController, :home
    get "/login", AuthController, :login
    get "/logout", AuthController, :logout
  end
```

We are now using a new controller `AuthController`.
Let's create it.
Inside `lib/app_web/controllers`, 
create a new file called `auth_controller.ex`
and paste the following.

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  def login(conn, _params) do
    redirect(conn, external: AuthPlug.get_auth_url(conn, ~p"/"))
  end

  def logout(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> AuthPlug.logout()
    |> put_status(302)
    |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
  end
end
```

We just now need to change the view
to redirect to these URLs (`login` and `logout`).
Head over to `lib/app_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`,
locate the line.

```html
<div class="px-4 py-10 sm:py-28 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:py-32 xl:px-28">
```

From this line to the end of the file,
change the contents with the next lines:

```html
<div class="px-4 py-10 sm:py-28 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 xl:py-32 xl:px-28">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl lg:mx-0">

```

And you should be done!
In our main page we are checking if any user is logged in or not.
If there's a user authenticated, 
we show his username and a button in which he can press
to purchase our sweet dashboard.

On the other hand, if there isn't any user authenticated, 
a `login` button is shown.

The app should look like the following.

![with_auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209171533-2a51572b-2d0f-4789-a28b-7d77771caaa5.gif)

Now that we got that out of the way,
we can now *focus on integrating `Stripe`*
in our Phoenix application.

This is going to be fun, let's do this! 👏

## 3. Stripe integration

Let's start by installing the package
that will allows us to communicate with **Stripe**.
We are going to be using 
[`stripity-stripe`](https://github.com/beam-community/stripity-stripe).
This library will allow us to easily integrate Stripe in our Phoenix application.

Go to your `mix.exs` file
and add this inside your dependency section.

```elixir
{:stripity_stripe, "~> 2.17"}
```

and run `mix deps.get` to fetch this new dependency.
Following [their documentation](https://github.com/beam-community/stripity-stripe#configuration),
we need to add the next configuration inside `config.ex`.

```elixir
config :stripity_stripe, api_key: System.get_env("STRIPE_API_KEY")
```

As you can see, we are using an environment variable
to serve the `STRIKE_API_KEY` so the library can use it to make requests.
We need to add these keys to our `.env` file.
To check your own API keys, 
go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikey

<img width="1345" alt="keys" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/208983428-c75a0df2-a088-40fe-a68c-3193c829a3a4.png">

and paste the keys in your `.env` file.

```
export STRIPE_API_KEY= secret key
export STRIPE_PUBLIC= publishable key
```

After inputting these keys, 
you can stop the server and,
in the same terminal session, run `source .env`,
so you can load these environment variables
and so they are available when you run `mix phx.server` again.

Awesome job! 🎉
We can now start using it!

### 3.1 Creating a **Stripe Checkout Session**

To make this tutorial simple, 
we are going to be using a [`Stripe Checkout`](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout).
This makes it easy to make a payment 
because the user is redirected to a page hosted by `Stripe` 
with information about the product being purchased. 
Therefore, we don't need to create the page ourselves.
We *could* but this is quicker 😉.

With this in mind, 
we want to create a [`checkout session`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions).
The user will either be successful with his payment
or fail. 
We will be building a page for both.

Let's implement this.

Head on to to `lib/app_web/router.ex`
and add the following scope.

```elixir
  scope "/purchase", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    pipe_through :auth

    resources "/checkout-session", CheckoutSessionController, only: [:create]

    get "/success", PageController, :success
    get "/cancel", PageController, :cancel
  end
```

We want **only authenticated users** to go to
`/purchase/checkout-session` to purchase our product.
When they visit this URL, they will be redirected to our `Stripe Checkout` page,
with information about our product.
They payment will either *succeed* 
(users will be redirected to `/purchase/success`)
or *fail*
(users will be redirected to `/purchase/cancel`).

While the `success` and `cancel` pages 
are being handled by the already existent `PageController`,
redirecting the users to the `Stripe Checkout` page 
is being handled by `CheckoutSessionController`. 
We need to create it!

Inside `lib/app_web/controllers/`, 
create a file called `checkout_session_controller.ex`
and paste the code:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.CheckoutSessionController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  def create(conn, _params) do
    url = AppWeb.Endpoint.url()

    params = %{
      line_items: [
        %{
          price: System.get_env("PRODUCT_PRICE_ID"),
          quantity: 1
        }
      ],
      mode: "payment",
      # https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/custom-success-page
      success_url: url <> ~p"/purchase/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
      cancel_url: url <> ~p"/purchase/cancel?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
      # user_email: conn.assigns.person.email,
      automatic_tax: %{enabled: true}
    }

    {:ok, session} = Stripe.Session.create(params)

    conn
    |> put_status(303)
    |> redirect(external: session.url)
  end
end
```

Let's analyze the code.

We are using `Stripe.session.create/1` 
to create a [`Session`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions)
in Stripe. 
We need to pass a few required parameters. 
We are following [their API specification](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object),
so you can always check their documentation if you're lost
on what fields you need to pass.
- the `**mode**` field pertains to the mode of the checkout session.
We can setup subscription or one-time payments.
We are doing the latter.
- the `**success_url**` and `**cancel_url**` refer to the redirection URLs
after the user either completes or cancels the checkout session.
We are adding a `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template in the URL.
This tells Stripe to pass the `Checkout Session ID` to the client-side.
[This will allow us to customize the order information
upon completion or cancellation.](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/custom-success-page)
- we set `**automatic_tax**` to be enabled so it makes tax conversions automatically.
- the `**line_items**` array refer to the list of items the customer is purchasing.
We are passing the item `id` and the `quantity`.
- you can optionally pass a `customer_email`, 
so the field is already defined within the checkout session from the get-go.

We are then creating a session 
and redirecting the user to the `Checkout` page.

As you might have noticed, 
we are using an environment variable `PRODUCT_PRICE_ID`
to set `price` field of the product.

We *haven't created this yet*.
So let's do it!

### 3.2 Creating a `Product` to sell

As it stands, we have no products for customers to purchase.
Let's create one! 😎

Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create
and fill up the information about your product.


<img width="1239" alt="product_information" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209212460-b04c1ab0-0f6c-4365-b634-b6788d9aaffc.png">

> This should be all you need to do.
However, sometimes you may experience an error
while creating a `checkout session` 
when doing the request in Phoenix.
>
> The error is probably 
`Stripe Tax has not been activated on your account. 
Please visit https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax/activate to get started.`
Don't be alarmed.
If you follow the link, enable `Stripe Tax`
and just create a tax rate on whatever country you want,
You can check your tax rates in 
https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates.
>
> <img width="1350" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209214128-e199279d-a3b6-4f99-9184-8417369e0af8.png">

After creating your product,
you will be redirected to the page of the product created.
You can always check the products you created 
in https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products.

The page of the product created should look like this.

<img width="1239" alt="product page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209214262-24dc0852-7a78-46d3-a907-368ce4bab2b6.png">

We are going to be using the `API ID` 
in the Pricing section. 
Copy it and paste it in your `.env` file.

```
export PRODUCT_PRICE_ID= price id
```

In the same terminal session, kill the server,
run `source .env` and you should be good to go!

### 3.3 Success and failure after `Checkout Session`

As we've stated before, 
the users are redirected to a `success` or `cancel` page
depending on the outcome of the `Checkout Session`.

Since we defined these endpoints 
be controlled by `PageController`, 
we need to add these handlers.

Go to `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`
and add the following piece of code:

```elixir
  def success(conn, %{"session_id" => session_id}) do
    case Stripe.Session.retrieve(session_id) do
      {:ok, _session} ->
        render(conn, :success, layout: false)

      {:error, _error} ->
        conn
        |> put_status(303)
        |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
    end
  end

  def success(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> put_status(303)
    |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
  end

  def cancel(conn, %{"session_id" => session_id}) do

    case Stripe.Session.retrieve(session_id) do
      {:ok, _session} ->
        render(conn, :cancel, layout: false)

      {:error, _error} ->
        conn
        |> put_status(303)
        |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
    end
  end

  def cancel(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> put_status(303)
    |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
  end
```

Let's break it down.

When creating a session, 
we are requesting Stripe to redirect the user
*back* to us with a query parameter `session_id`
with the session ID.

This `session_id` will allow us to 
conditionally render these pages according to the outcome
of the process.

Both `success` and `cancel` workflows have the same workflow.

When the customer successfully pays for the product,
we check if the `session_id` is valid 
by retrieving it from `Stripe`.

```elixir
Stripe.Session.retrieve(session_id)
```

If it is successful, we render a page confirming the payment.
If it is not, we simply redirect the user to the homepage.
If the user tries to directly access `/purchase/success`,
he is redirected to the homepage as well.

The same procedure happens in the `cancel` scenario.

We now need to create these pages!
Inside `lib/app_web/controllers/page_html`,
create two files.
Create `success.html.heex` 
and use this code:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
    <div class="p-6  md:mx-auto">

In this page, we are thanking the user
for completing the payment 
and giving him the option to access
the ever so glorious ✨**dashboard**✨.

In the same directory,
create the `cancel.html.heex` file:

```elixir
<section class="flex items-center h-screen p-16">
	<div class="container flex flex-col items-center justify-center px-5 mx-auto my-8">
		<div class="max-w-lg text-center">

				Oh no...

			<p class="text-2xl font-semibold md:text-3xl">looks like something went wrong.</p>
			<p class="mt-4 mb-8 dark:text-gray-400">Perhaps you cancelled your order? Internet went down? We can help you get back on track!</p>
            <.link
                href={~p"/"}
                class="px-8 py-3 font-semibold rounded text-white bg-violet-400"
            >
                Back to homepage
            </.link>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>
```

In this page, 
we state that something went wrong 
and show a button to return to the homepage.

### 3.4 Making our "`dashboard`" cool

We don't really have a `dashboard` to show.
In fact, we don't need to, it's out of the scope of this tutorial.
So let's just show a Nyan Cat! 🐈

Inside `lib/app_web/controllers/app_html/app.html.heex`,
change the code to the following:

```elixir
<div class="bg-bottom h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/brudnak/aba00c9a1c92d226f68e8ad8ba1e0a40/raw/e1e4a92f6072d15014f19aa8903d24a1ac0c41a4/nyan-cat.gif"
            alt="Nyan cat"
            class="max-w-[60%]"
            />
    <div class="text-center">
        <h3 class="md:text-5xl text-base text-gray-900 font-semibold text-center">Nyan Cat!</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 my-2">Yup, it's a nyan cat. It's not a dashboard.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-12 mb-12">sorry.</p>

        <.link
            navigate={~p"/"}
            class="text-white bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-blue-700 hover:bg-gradient-to-br
            focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 dark:focus:ring-blue-800 shadow-lg
            shadow-blue-500/50 dark:shadow-lg dark:shadow-blue-800/80 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center mr-2 mb-2 "
            >
            go back
        </.link>
    </div>
</div>
```

All that's left is for the `Purchase` button
in our homepage to redirect the user
to the `/purchase/checkout-session`
for the customer to pay for the product.

Inside `lib/app_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`,
locate the line:

```html
<span class="relative px-5 py-2.5 transition-all ease-in duration-75 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-md group-hover:bg-opacity-0">
    Purchase
</span>
```

And replace it with:

```html
<.link
  href={~p"/purchase/checkout-session"}
  method="post"
  class="relative px-5 py-2.5 transition-all ease-in duration-75 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-md group-hover:bg-opacity-0"
>
  Purchase
</.link>
```

And you should be done! 🎉

Let's see what we've done so far.
Run `mix phx.server` 
(make sure you loaded the env variables
with `source .env`) 
and visit `localhost:4000`.
You should see the following! 👏

![stripe_integrated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209217397-4b1c1cb4-6777-4ca0-998e-b860030642a8.gif)

> You can complete the payment 
using test data with the credit card.
You can fill whatever e-mail address (real or not)
or name to pay. 
The expiry date and CVC can also be random.
>
> - Payment succeeds: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
> - Payment requires authentication: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
> - Payment is declined: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

You can check the customers info in 
https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers.
You may delete the customers, if you want.

## 4. Blocking unpaid users from `dashboard`

We now got a decent workflow going.
But authenticated can still access `/dashboard`
while just being authenticated.
We want them to be logged in 
*and also have paid to access it*.

We are currently not tracking our customers
who have paid and should be granted access.
We are going to be needing to create
a way to save `User`s object 
with the referring `stripe_id` 
and a boolean field referring to the payment status.

We could use a PostgresSQL engine for this,
but for this use case it's a bit overkill.
Instead, to simplify deployment,
we will be using 
[`Erland Term Storage (ETS)`](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/storage/ets).
This is a in-memory storage engine built into OTP 
and can be employed to store large amounts of data 
*with constant time data access*.
Do note that since this engine is in-memory,
**all data is lost when the process ends/server is shutdown**.

There is an Elixir wrapper that makes it easy to use `ETS` and `DETS`, 
where the latter is a disk-based variant of the former,
where data is persisted on disk.
We'll be using
[`pockets`](https://github.com/fireproofsocks/pockets).

Let's install it.

Add it to the `deps` section inside `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pockets, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

With that installed, 
we are going to be creating a module 
that will *manage the users table*.
We are going to create it on startup,
and create users/edit them.

For that, create a file in `lib/app/users.ex`.

```elixir
defmodule UsersTable do

  alias Pockets

  @table :users_table
  @filepath "cache.dets"

  def init do
    case Pockets.new(@table, @filepath) do
      {:ok, set} -> {:ok, set}
      {:error, _} ->
        Pockets.open(@table, @filepath)
    end
  end

  def create_user(%{:stripe_id => stripe_id, :person_id => person_id, :status => status}) do
    Pockets.put(@table, person_id, %{stripe_id: stripe_id, status: status})
  end

  def fetch_user(person_id) do
    Pockets.get(@table, person_id)
  end

end
```

Let's go over what we have done.
We are going to be saving our users
with a tuple containing the `**stripe_id**`,
the `person_id` of the logged in user
and a `**status**` boolean field,
referring to whether the user has paid or not.

All the functions being used are used
according to the [`ets` wrapper documentation](https://github.com/TheFirstAvenger/ets).
- the `init/0` function creates the table to store our users.
If the file already exists, we open the file.
- `create_user/3` receives a `stripe_id`, `person_id` and `status` 
(pertaining to whether the payment has been made or not)
and creates a user object.
- `fetch_user/1` retrieves the persisted user
according to the given` person_id`.

Let's make use of some of these functions.
We want to setup the `DETS` table on the process startup.
For this, we are going to initiate the table
on the `start/1` function inside `lib/app/application.ex`.
This function is executed when the process is created,
so it fits right our needs!
Add the following code below the `children` array variable
inside `start/1`.

```elixir
UsersTable.init()
```

We now need to **create the user** every time 
a Stripe session is successful. 
We can do this inside `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`
on the `success/2` callback.
Change the handler, so it looks like the following:

```elixir
def success(conn, %{"session_id" => session_id}) do

  case Stripe.Session.retrieve(session_id) do
    {:ok, session} ->

      person_id = conn.assigns.person.id
      UsersTable.create_user(%{person_id: person_id, stripe_id: session.customer, status: true})

      render(conn, :success, layout: false)

    {:error, _error} ->
      conn
      |> put_status(303)
      |> redirect(to: ~p"/")
  end
end
```

Now, inside `lib/app_web/controllers/app_+controller.ex`,
we will render our "dashboard"
**only** if a user is found in our `Users` table.
If there isn't a user found, we redirect the user to the homepage.
Change the `home/2` function so it looks like the following.

```elixir
def home(conn, _params) do

  person_id = conn.assigns.person.id
  case UsersTable.fetch_user(person_id) do
    nil ->
      conn |> redirect(to: ~p"/")

    _ ->
      render(conn, :app, layout: false)
  end
end
```

All there's left to do 
is to change the `Purchase` button to dynamically change.
We want paid users to access the dashboard directly,
and non-paid users to purchase it.

To do this, add this function
in `lib/app_web/controllers/page_html.ex`.

```elixir
  def check_user_has_paid(person_id) do
    user = UsersTable.fetch_user(person_id)

    if user == nil, do: false, else: user.status
  end
```

Inside `lib/app_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`,
change the `Purchase` button so it changes according to the user's payment status.

```html
<%= if check_user_has_paid(@conn.assigns.person.id) do %>
    <.link
      href={~p"/dashboard"}
      class="relative px-5 py-2.5 transition-all ease-in duration-75 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-md group-hover:bg-opacity-0"
    >
      Enter
    </.link>
  <% else %>
    <.link
      href={~p"/purchase/checkout-session"}
      method="post"
      class="relative px-5 py-2.5 transition-all ease-in duration-75 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-md group-hover:bg-opacity-0"
    >
      Purchase
    </.link>
  <% end %>
```

## 5. All done! 🎉

And you should be done!
The user can now pay for our product.
We are restricting user access for only users that have paid.
Users that *have* made the payment **will have access**.
